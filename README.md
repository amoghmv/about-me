# About-me

### Hi, I'm Amogh 👋  
**Not a data wizard (I wish). Just someone who likes asking the right questions.**

---

I come from a business and finance background,where data was pretty central, but rarely were utilised to its full potential.  
Over time, I got more interested in systems, patterns, and utilising tools than just staring and reading into dashboards.  
Let’s just say I didn’t want to spend my life staring at spreadsheets, but also try to understand them and how they answer to my problem.

This isn’t a pivot *away* from finance — it’s a build *on top* of it. I'm using finance as a foundation to **explore data, models, and code.**

---

### 🔁 Why the Shift?

- I've always worked with numbers, but wanted more control over the tools that interpret them  
- Business/Finance taught me to ask the right questions. Now I’m learning how to answer them with *code*  
- Exploring Python, SQL, statistics, and visualization, with a focus on clarity, not just raw hype.

### 🏗️ In Progress

**-Not only these ones below, but I'm also pursuing MOOCs and studying subjects like: Machine Learning, Mathematics - Probability, Calculus,Linear Algebra, etc. and Programming.**

- **Stock price prediction and analysis of Apple stock**  
- **Credit Risk prediction model**
- **Fraud detection model**

These aren’t generic portfolio projects. I’m building them to explore real data, uncover patterns, and communicate insights clearly.

### 🧰 Interests

- Quantitative analysis rooted in real context  
- Visual storytelling without making it look overpolished and 'for show'.
- Understanding *why* models fail - errors
- Pattern recognition, process optimization, and open datasets  
- Understand code and how to make it more optimised
