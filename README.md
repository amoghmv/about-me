# about-me

### Hi, I'm Amogh 👋  
**Not a data wizard. Just someone who likes asking the right questions.**

---

I come from a business and finance background — where data was central, but rarely pushed to its full potential.  
Over time, I got more interested in systems, patterns, and building tools than just reading dashboards.  
Let’s just say I didn’t want to spend my life staring at spreadsheets.

This isn’t a pivot *away* from finance — it’s a build *on top* of it. I'm using finance as a foundation to **explore data, models, and code.**

---

### 🔁 Why the Shift?

- I've always worked with numbers — but wanted more control over the tools that interpret them  
- Business taught me to ask the right questions. Now I’m learning how to answer them with *code*  
- Exploring Python, SQL, statistics, and visualization — with a focus on clarity over hype

### 🏗️ In Progress

- **Indian Road Accident Analysis** — uncovering patterns in timing, geography, and cause  
- **Airbnb Pricing Project** — predicting price bands from listing features in Indian cities  

These aren’t generic portfolio projects. I’m building them to explore real data, uncover patterns, and communicate insights clearly.

### 🧰 Interests

- Quantitative analysis rooted in real context  
- Visual storytelling without over-polishing  
- Understanding *why* models fail - errors
- Pattern recognition, process optimization, and open datasets  
- Learning to ship cleaner code, faster
