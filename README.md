# Hi, I'm Amogh 👋  

Not a **finance wizard** (I wish). Just someone who likes asking the right questions.  

- I come from a **business and finance** background, where **data** was pretty central 
- Over time, I got more interested in systems, patterns, and the tools behind them

**I’m deliberately building a niche at the intersection of **finance** and technology, using **financial knowledge** as the foundation to explore **data**, models, and code.**

By the time I realised what I liked, I was 19 years old. I didn’t treat that as a late start, just as a clearer direction.  

### 🔁 Why the MERGE?  
- I've always worked with numbers, but wanted more control over the tools that interpret them  
- **Business/Finance** taught me to ask the right questions. Now I’m learning how to answer them properly and wisely.  
- Exploring math, statistics, stock markets, investments, with **finance** as my anchor point and tech as the amplifier  
- Growing interest in **financial analysis**, **investment analysis**, and **risk analysis**, not just as theory but applied with modern tools  

### 🏗️ In Progress  
Not only these ones below, but I'm also actively **investing** and generating **returns from the stock market**, working on my blog and hosting podcasts with people as a passion project, and pursuing MOOCs on **Finance**, **Mathematics**, and **Programming**.  

### 🧰 Interests  
- Building a niche in **finance** through data and tech tools  
- **Financial analysis**, **investment analysis**, and **risk analysis**  
- Analysing **financial data**, **stocks** and **cash flows**
